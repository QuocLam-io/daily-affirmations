    "description": "To enjoy something, I simply need to add joy to it. Joy is like butter-- I can put it on anything and it'll make it way better. Today, I will add joy to everything, really slather it on. Today, I am the Orville Redenbacher of joy. And life's popcorn is about to get it."

    "title": "Connection",
    "description": "I'm connected to the multitudes, and I can access their support at any time. Even a stranger offers a sense of comfort when they smile at me or make a dumb comment about the weather. Everyone is waiting to connect... all I need to o is open myself up and pay attention. (Note to self: work on witty banter about weather-related stuff.)"

    "title": "Clarity",
    "description": "Stopping to listen to my inner self, I can easily separate my intuition from my mental chatter. The clarity of my intuition is a sweet, simple fruit that tastes familiar. And the mental chatter is a confusing, bitter rind that I shall peel off and chuck into the garbage (or compost heap, if your mental chatter happens to be organic.)"

    "title": "Engagement",
    "description": "Today, I make the conscious choice ot engage with the world in an active way. I'll take a new route and talk to strangers. I will smell flowers and pet dogs, and maybe walk around barefoot for a while if I'm not inside a 7-11. At the very least, I'll have a day that's slightly more interesting than average. And at the most, I'll have a startling epiphany or make a friend who will change my life forever. No pressure."

My ideal partnerships and working relationships are easy and free-flowing. I deserve greatness, because I am greatness. And, to paraphrase Rumi: what I'm looking for is also looking for me. In fact, he or she might be paraphrasing Rumi right now. Hmm..."

    "description": "I am strong, I am grounded, I am powerful. I am like a cross between a dinosaur and a tank. But not a tank that is used for war. I am like a peaceful, loving dino-tank who feels so strong it doesn't need to do anything but be."

    "title": "Inspiration",
    "description": "There isa  voice of inspiration within me. Right now it's only a whisper, but the more I listen, the louder it will get. Soon it will be a flawless speech, voiced by James Earl Jones, through a megaphone, with lots of applause."

    "title": "Love",
    "description": "Love is a many-splendored thing. Today I will notice and appreciate at least three of those splendors. Life the fact that puppies make me feel like a parent. Or the surge of self-congratulation I feel when I sink a three-point trash-basket shot on the first try. Or how 'bout the chills I get while singing along _____________"

    "description": "I am exactly where I need to be, exactly when I need to be. There's nothing I need to do. I mean, yes there will always be laundry and texes-- but in terms of my life's path, I don't need to do anything because I am already here. I take a deep breath, relax, and trust (and then do laundry)."
